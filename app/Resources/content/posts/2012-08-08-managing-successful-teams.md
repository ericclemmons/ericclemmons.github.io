# Managing Successful Teams

I _manage_ (and hate that word) a team of developers and analysts at [CMN](http://cmn.com/).  The list below contains considerations that myself & my team contemplate with every thing we do, which I've found to make us highly successful, motivated, and happier as a result.

## Disclosure

Every person you _manage_ should be able to manage their own time & tasks by these five considerations.

### 1. Financial Impact

An individual should have a comprehensive understanding of the business model and the financial purpose behind the project.  This is typically the biggest indicator of where projects belong on a timeline.  This understanding should be prevalent enough such that deciding the order of deliverables is rarely necessary.

### 2. Impact on Colleagues

Environments are becoming incredibly social in regards to sharing responsibilities & tasks to accomplish a single goal or complete a project.  Knowing who is involved and in what capacity is fundamental in ensuring that individuals handle their tasks with the intent of reaching milestones together.

### 3. Impact on External Clients

Often, tasks & features don't have a significant financial impact on things like revenue, but have a significant impact on overlooked factors like time, salary expense, learning curve, or hindering progress.  For example, if a data-entry team constantly uses an admin interface that requires significant back-and-forth from the keyboard to the mouse, any optimization done can significantly decrease the amount of time to accomplish a task.  Another example is when improving a system and potentially changing the API feed structure as a result.  Improving the system has obvious benefits, but imposing those changes on 3rd party API consumers has a very negative impact.  Remedying that negative impact will surely cost time & money, in which prioritization of the project may vary with compared with other projects with little or no negative impact.

### 4. Time-sensitivity

When integrating with vendors and 3rd parties, responsibility is typically shared in ensuring deliverables meet certain time restrictions.  Seasonality (e.g. Christmas) is a great example of an external time constraint dictating the timeline for deliverables.

### 5. Labor & Time

Finally, every task & project requires the effort of an individual or a group of people, both of which have a very real salary expense and limitation on time.  Many companies make the mistake of treating employees' time as "free", since there is no direct cost to them.  However, salaries are typically the single largest expense in any business!  When regarding others' time as expensive and valuable, tasks tend to have more *purpose* and *focus*.

## Conclusion 

When individuals operate with these five factors, there is very little to *manage*.  All that's left is simply *facilitating* and *guiding* the process & individuals to success.

This is how I personally run my team at [CMN](http://cmn.com), and all of us couldn't be happier :)
