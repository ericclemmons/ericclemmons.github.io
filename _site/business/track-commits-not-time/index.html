	  <p>Several times in my career has the issue of tracking developers’ time come up.</p>

<p>Sometimes the result has been disastrous, causing a decline in morale and overall performance. Sometimes the result has been beneficial, as it was already a part of an existing workflow. However, as of now, time tracking has gone from a burden to a byproduct of our workflow.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p><img src="/assets/img/business/track-commits-not-time.jpg" alt="project commit history" /></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="why_track_time_at_all">Why Track Time at All?</h3>

<p>In my experience, there are really three reasons to track time (i.e. resources spent on a project):</p>

<ul>
<li>Accounting</li>

<li>Prioritization</li>

<li>Trust</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="accounting">Accounting</h4>

<p>Many software projects often constitute new development or maintenance. In the simplest of scenarios (as edge-cases will have to be accounted for in all circumstances), the following synopsis holds true:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Software development costs that add future value are typically capitalized. Expenditures that do not increase the value of the asset are expensed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Development costs typically constitute a large sum for the business and can easily affect financial reports. However, these reports absolutely must be accurate and defensible, which is why time tracking is commonly a pervasive hinderance to productivity &amp; workflow. (Rarely have I seen this overhead even accounted for.)</p>

<h4 id="prioritization">Prioritization</h4>

<p>Often time tracking is treated as an extremely granular indication that time and resources are spent on the projects matching that of the company’s strategy.</p>

<p>This is simply mischaracterizing the solution that time tracking provides as one for proper project management. In other words, this approach erroneously tracks the results rather than the initial direction.</p>

<h4 id="trust">Trust</h4>

<p>Perhaps this affects contractors more than salaried employees, but the problem exists nonetheless.</p>

<p>Without trust, anything else, such as time tracking, is trivial until this core tenant of the employee/employer relationship is resolved.</p>

<h3 id="tracking_time_is_a_burden">Tracking Time is a Burden</h3>

<p>The most frightening realization is when time is tracked accurately and both the developer and the employer realize how much non-coding time is “wasted.”</p>

<p>Fellow developers understand the huge value in walking away from a problem, bouncing ideas off of a coworker, or freeing your mind from the annoyances of a problem to come back moments later with a crystal-clear solution.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the reporting of these activities aren’t readily defensible from an investment perspective and, in all honesty, seems wrong from an outside perspective, particularly to a company who’s culture demands a seat being warmed from 8AM-5PM.</p>

<p>Many candid conversations I’ve had told of the same result – the time tracking turned into a daily estimating activity for each developer, which eventually turned into a weekly, and finally a monthly activity, becoming exceedingly less accurate and more presentable as it continued.</p>

<h3 id="a_better_way_to_track_time">A Better Way to Track Time</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>The following is the result of my professional discussions with various financial auditors and certified accountants based on specific projects. In other words, ask permission instead of begging forgiveness :)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clearly, the following solution is ideal for salaried employees. Contractors should track any client activities (e.g. meetings, research, development, etc.).</p>

<p>When I was tasked with itemizing employees’ time spent on various projects (that were either capitalized or expensed), luckily, resource distribution was very cut-and-dry.</p>

<p>First, cross-project development for a single developer within the workweek was rare, as we normally do weekly sprints on single large features or a single codebase. Second, work was almost exclusively new features or maintenance. Finally, we already use a clear branching scheme with prefixes like <code>feature</code>, <code>hotfix</code>, <code>issue</code>, etc.</p>

<p>Already having an accurate time-per-developer calculation in hand, I tested another method for comparison.</p>

<h3 id="my_simple_solution">My Simple Solution</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>If a developer’s workflow is consistent across projects with semantic commits/branches, then that itself is reflective of time spent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It turns out, most developers I’ve worked with, like myself, make very atomic, de-coupled commits. Add in the fact that our branch names indicated the time of work being done, and results were nearly identical!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(Commits per Project) / (Total Commits) = % Time on Project</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Granted, we had fixed prioritization meetings each week and scheduled events, but those were easily calculated out of the bottom line.</p>

<p>The amazing thing is, <strong>everything we were doing was already part of our workflow</strong>.</p>

<p>If you have the opportunity to investigate time tracking alternatives, I would eagerly invite you to do the same and discuss <em>workflow tracking</em> over <em>time tracking</em> with your company.</p>

<p>Likewise, if you have suggestions or improvements to how to best correlate time with workflow, I would love to hear from you!</p>
